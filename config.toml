# Checks are organized into groups, each with a file pattern and list of rules.
# Pattern uses glob syntax: "*.cpp, *.h" matches C++ files, "*" matches all files.

# C++/Qt specific checks

rules = [
    "Check for any detectable errors and suggest code simplifications where possible.",
    "Check that iteration continues automatically until the final result, without requiring user prompts to proceed.",

    "Check that stack allocation is preferred over heap allocation whenever possible.",
    "Check that string literals are handled through QStringView variables.",
    "Check that string literals used multiple times are stored in named QStringView constants instead of being repeated.",
    "Check that comments provide meaningful context or rationale and avoid restating obvious code behavior.",
    "Check that functions are implemented in .cpp files rather than .h files.",
