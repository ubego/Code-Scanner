model = "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct"  # Optional for LM Studio
timeout = 600            # Request timeout in seconds
context_limit = 16384    # Context window size in tokens (minimum 16384 recommended)

# Ollama alternative (uncomment and comment out LM Studio above):
# backend = "ollama"     # Use Ollama backend
# host = "localhost"
# port = 11434           # Ollama default port
# model = "qwen3:4b"     # Model name (REQUIRED for Ollama)
# timeout = 600
