# Code Scanner Configuration for Java Projects
# Human-focused checks - linters (Checkstyle, SpotBugs) handle syntax/style.

# Copy this file to your project root as `config.toml`.

# LLM Backend Configuration
# ==============================================================================

[llm]
# LM Studio (default)
backend = "lm-studio"   # Backend type: "lm-studio" or "ollama"
host = "localhost"       # Server hostname (usually localhost)
port = 1234              # Server port (LM Studio default: 1234, Ollama: 11434)
model = "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct"  # Optional for LM Studio
timeout = 600            # Request timeout in seconds
context_limit = 16384    # Context window size in tokens (minimum 16384 recommended)

# Ollama alternative (uncomment and comment out LM Studio above):
# backend = "ollama"     # Use Ollama backend
# host = "localhost"
# port = 11434           # Ollama default port
# model = "qwen3:4b"     # Model name (REQUIRED for Ollama)
# timeout = 600
# context_limit = 16384
